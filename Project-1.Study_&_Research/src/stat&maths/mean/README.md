## Mean

<p>One of the essential concept in statistics, mathematical analysis, and computer science is the mean. The mean is the average of a set of numbers. The mean is a measure of central tendency.</p>

<p> The concept  of mean is used in various fields of science, engineering, and mathematics.</p>


## How to calculate the mean?

Since there are different types of mean, we will discuss about `Arthematic Mean`.

***Arthematic Mean***
is the total of all the numbers divided by the number of numbers.
It is calculated as follows:

```python
    mean = sum of all numbers / number of numbers
```

In Statistics, we can find out population mean and sample mean. Population mean is the mean of the entire population. Sample mean is the mean of a sample of data. Both means is the mean of the entire population. but writing way is different. Populatyion mean can be written as:

```python
    mean = sum of all numbers / number of numbers
```

## Why use Arthematic Mean?

The mean is important because it gives us a general idea of the central tendency of the data. The mean is also important because it carries a piece of information from every observation in a dataset.



## Disadvantages of Arthematic Mean

<p>The mean can be misleading if the data is skewed or contains outliers. These are values that are unusual compared to the rest of the data set by being especially small or large in numerical value.</p>

<p> For example:

<table>
  <tr>
  <td>staff</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>7</td>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>9</td>
    <td>10</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>salary</td>
    <td>10k</td>
    <td>15k</td>
    <td>16k</td>
    <td>15k</td>
    <td>17k</td>
    <td>12k</td>
    <td>18k</td>
    <td>14k</td>
    <td>95k</td>
    <td>90k</td>
  </tr>
</table>


The mean of the above dataset is 30.2 k. However, inspecting the raw data suggests that this mean value might not be the best way to accurately reflect the typical salary of a worker, as most workers have salaries in the $10k to 18k range. The mean is being skewed by two large salaries, $95k and $90M. </p>
