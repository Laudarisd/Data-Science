Data science is an emerging fiels with numerous opportunities. Every data scientist require a skill of handling
data from server. Here, I would like to talk about SQL and NoSQL.

First, what is `DBMS`, RDBMS` and `Non RDBMS` ?

***DBMS***

Database Management System is a special software program that helps users to create and maintain database.

Basically, database management is a `C.R.U.D`.


- C -- Create
- R -- Read/Retrive
- U -- Update
- D -- Delete


***RDBMS***

Relational Database Mangement System --- `MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, MariaDB and etc`.

***Non RDBMS***

Non Relational database Management Systme --- NoSQL, i.e. `MongoDB, dynamoDB, Apache Cassandra

-------------------------------------------------------

**SQL**

Structured Querry Language(SQL) is a sequal database. it is a `Relational Database`. In SQL, each table has columns and rows. In SQL we called attribute to single column and entry to single row.

***Key***

In SQL, we need to understnad about keys before understnading data system.

Here are few keys:

- Candidate Key
- Primary Key
- Foreign Key
- Super Key
- Alternate Key
- Composite Key
- Unique Key


SQl is actually a hybrid language. It has four types of language in one.

1. Data Querry Language(DQL)
2. Data Definition Language(DDL)
3. Data Central Language(DCL)
4. Data Manipulation Language(DML)


### So what is Querry?
A querry is a set of instruction given to the RDBMS(written in SQL) that tells the RDBMS what information you want it to retrive for you.
