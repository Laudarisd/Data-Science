## Project-1: Study & Research

This project is a collection of studies and research that I have conducted in the field of data science. It includes exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, and other research techniques.

## Project-2: Regression

In this project, I explore various regression techniques, including linear regression, polynomial regression, and decision tree regression. I also compare the performance of these techniques on a real-world dataset.

## Project-3: Energy Data Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing energy consumption data. I explore various data visualization techniques and use machine learning algorithms to predict energy consumption.

## Project-4: Anomaly Detection

In this project, I explore various techniques for detecting anomalies in data. I use techniques such as clustering, isolation forests, and one-class SVMs to detect anomalies in a real-world dataset.

## Project-5: All-In-One

This project is a collection of various data science techniques and algorithms that I have implemented. It includes techniques such as clustering, classification, regression, and anomaly detection.

## Project-6: GeoSpatial Data

In this project, I explore various techniques for analyzing geospatial data. I use techniques such as k-means clustering, DBSCAN, and spatial autocorrelation to analyze geospatial data.

## Project-7: Machine Learning

This project focuses on various machine learning techniques, including supervised and unsupervised learning. I explore techniques such as k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines.

## Project-8: Data Science Practice

In this project, I practice various data science techniques and algorithms on real-world datasets. It includes techniques such as data cleaning, data visualization, and machine learning.

## Project-9: Deep Learning Python

This project focuses on deep learning techniques using Python. I explore techniques such as convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and long short-term memory networks.
